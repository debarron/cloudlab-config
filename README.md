# cloudlab-config
My current Cloudlab configuration.
Here I go berserk mode and configure:
- Cluster's network
- Node's dependencies
- OpenSlide at each node
- RAMCloud and FUSE at each node
- Hadoop and Spark at each node
 
# How to run it?
 You need to run the following command and wait a couple of mins.
 `./cloudlab-configure.sh <NODE_LIST_FILE> <USER_NAME> <PRIVATE_SSH_KEY> <LOCAL_STORAGE>`

This project is not optimized, I just need to run all the scripts.
I'll make it better one day.
